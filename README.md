# Haxbyssimalarity
This is a similarity MVPA analysis using the Haxby dataset as a proof of concept to run sub-training similarity.
The project was written in the Jupyter(iPython) notebook using python packages including nilear,sklearn, numpy, pandas, and seaborn.

Images of Cats and human faces are trained against shoes and houses (living,vs non-living) and the the distances from the 
hyperplane are explored for each category.

The html provided is an example of the results that I got so the whole script doesn't need to be run to take a quick look at the project.
The .pynb is provided so that individuals can run the analysis themselves and explore other asepcts of the project not included.
